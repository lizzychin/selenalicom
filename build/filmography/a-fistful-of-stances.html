    <p><strong>Au Yeung Wai-Lan</strong> (<em>Yuen Chau</em>), owner of a martial arts training school, is reunited with her long-lost son <strong>Koo Yu-Cheung</strong> (<em>Kevin Cheng</em>) after years of agonizing separation. On his return home, Cheung is shocked to find that his younger brother <strong>Koo Yu-Tong</strong> (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>) has been critically ill and that his father was murdered long ago by <strong>Wing Tak</strong> (<em>Dominic Lam</em>), the existing director of a pharmaceutical company and a bitter old foe of the Koo's. Cheung has never been into kung-fu but shows glimpses of his potential when he strikes back at the impudent, arrogant <strong>Wing Man-Kwan</strong> (<em>Jacky Heung</em>), also the son of Tak. Pinning all her hopes on Cheung, Lan not only teaches him a special set of kung-fu skills created by the family, but also registers for him for the Guangdong Boxing Championship Tournament. Out of the blue, Cheung's opponent in the final turns out to be Kwan.  starts losing his bearings after achieving growing success and recognition in the field of martial arts. Caught up in the love triangle between Lan's apprentice <strong>Ying Ngan Ming</strong> (<em>Natalie Tong</em>), his dream girl <strong>Chow Mui Mui</strong> (<em>Nancy Wu</em>) and himself, Cheung is utterly confused and exhausted, which later causes his failure in the final tournament.</p>

              <div id="personality" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">A kind-hearted, cordial and pleasant person. Although she is born in a wealthy family, but she's not arrogant at all. She’s glad to help people, charitable in thought and deed, she's exceptionally intelligent. Knows when to share, she is independent-minded, has her own ideas, has a very tough character, she’s a woman from the modern generation. Towards things that cannot go through the eyes she'll fight the injustice, she will not yield and she often opposes her father Wing Tak (<em>Dominic Lam</em>). She's faithful towards love, for love she is willing to be penalized.</div>
              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Wing family’s eldest daughter; her father Tak has high hopes for Ching, he let her have good education, becoming a highborn lady. Although she lived in a wealthy family, never have to worry about food and clothing, but unlike other daughters from wealthy families she doesn’t have a spoiled and bossy character. Since her childhood she is kind-hearted, when she was young she saw in the pharmacy sick people suffering from pain, this made her cherish her wish to become a doctor in the future. She returned to Hong Kong after finishing her education and she really became a doctor in a public hospital, she hopes that all sick people will receive the best care.</div>
              <div id="happenings" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">By pure chance Ching came across a special western medicine for the threatment of Koo Yu Tong’s (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>) asthma, Tong was shocked. Since then, whenever Tong came in troubles and has to compete with others in fighting, he’ll look for Ching to take the miracle drug to help him out of his predicament. Because of this, Ching’s understanding for Tong deepened. Ching discovered that although Tong’s attitude is quite arrogant, but he treasures his family the most. Even more, he is not afraid of larger powers, he suppresses the strong and aids the weak. Ching’s attraction to him grows.  Yeung Wai Lan (<em>Yuen Chau</em>) once has abdominal pain, Ching diagnosed it as chronic appendicitis, this required her to undergo a surgery, but Lan was afraid that after anesthesia she won’t wake up anymore and she refused the threatment. Lan’s condition became worse by the day. Ching didn’t feel annoyed when she personally tried to convince Lan many times, this made her leave a good impression on Lan. Because of Tong’s and others’ filial obedience for their mother and she was moved by the family’s warmth, Ching saved Lan’s life when Lan finally agreed to let Ching perform the surgery. , Ching injured her foot, Tong took good care of her by healing her with liniment, they developed deeper feelings for each other. Sadly, the grudge of the two families are deeply entangled. When Ching found out that Tak is the murderer of Tong's grandfather and other people, she couldn't believe it. When Tak learnt of Tong and Ching's contact, he was furious, this deepened his hatred for Tong's family even more.  constantly did things to harm Tong's family, Ching felt very guilty, she was trapped between the hatred of the two families, this caused her to suffer greatly. Although Ching loved Tong truly, but their relationship was full of barriers. Finally, Ching forsakes the darkness for light, but whether the two can end up happily together remains unpredictable.</div>
