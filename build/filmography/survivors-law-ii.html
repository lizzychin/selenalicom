Because she didn't has a low education, having contact with a big lawyer as boyfriend, unavoidably makes her think that she sought friendship with somebody of a higher social standing and made her feel inferior. She has perseverance and a high patience. After she was abandoned by her boyfriend, she discovered that she's pregnant from him, but still resolutely wants to give birth to their baby and look after him at her own.</div>
              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Choi Yuk was raised up in a low social class. In order to have a good life, her parents stayed often in Mainland for work and she is used to take care of herself. Because life is hard, after Choi Yuk completed her secondary school, she directly stepped into the society. She has worked at several cafes and restaurants as waitress, having an ordinary life.</div>
              <div id="happenings" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Some years ago, Choi Yuk worked at a cafe shop and noted a frequent customer: a gentle man, who often comes at his own, always sitting in a corner of the shop. One day, Choi Yuk saw that the frequent customer looked lost and she specially flushed the cup ",Siu Ha Ha" coffee to cheer him up, afterwards he became her boyfriend, this man is Cheuk Wai Ming (<em>Sammul Chan</em>).  Yuk is very supportive towards Wai Ming, whose career has gone downhill. During the days of their cohabitation, Choi Yuk was aware of Wai Ming preparing for his work after his resumption, so she secretly saved a sum of money, she rather use money frugally, for Wai Ming she contemplates all the things. Apart from loving Wai Ming deeply, Choi Yuk has never dreamt of dating a professional lawyer with such a high education, so from the beginning to the end, she never has any sense of security. Although she tried her best to threw herself into their relationship during the days of their cohabitation, but Choi Yuk told herself that there's a too big difference between them, their relationship could end up at any time.  Choi Yuk has this mentality, she always puts herself in a second-class status. Living along with Wai Ming, has naturally produced a great sense of inferiority for her. So when the two are dating and they encounter an acquaintance, Choi Yuk would act quite evasive and even hide her relationship with Wai Ming. In the beginning, Wai Ming thought that Choi Yuk is silly, but after awhile, Wai Ming finds out that he and Choi Yuk are people from different worlds.  Wai Ming's business dinners, Choi Yuk didn't understand these business and official terms, she's always speechless. On the contrary, Wai Ming couldn't enter Choi Yuk's world too, even when it's Selena's parents, Wai Ming felt that he didn't match with them. It turns out that there's really a division between social classes, social class and love need a strong power to succeed together.  time, because Choi Yuk's mother was blinded by a light in a shopping mall and thus injured by a smoke door, she wants to claim a compensation from the mall and hopes that Wai Ming will help her. For his prospects, Wai Ming chose for the mall's side, because the mall's boss is businessman Suen Pak To (<em>Kwok Fung</em>). Because of this, Choi Yuk's mother was furious, she thought that Wai Ming helped the enemy. Choi Yuk was caught in the middle and had it very difficult too. But when she found out that Wai Ming even made use of her to get an evidence against her mother for the win of the case and even found out that Wai Ming started to pursue Pak To's daughter Lei Lei (<em>Ella Koon</em>), Choi Yuk understood that Wai Ming finally chose for his prospects and decided to gave up himself, she couldn't help but feel bitter only.</div>
