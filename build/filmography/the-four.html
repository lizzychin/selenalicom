        <p>Hard-hearted and smart <strong>Mo Ching</strong> (<em>Raymond Lam</em>) became a crippled when he was young. Fortunately Ching met <strong>Chu Kot Ching Ngo</strong> (<em>Dominic Lam</em>), the Head of the Sheriff Bureau, and learned from him his unparalleled skills of using concealed weapons. Chu has once helped the Sung Emperor recover an invaluable piece of article that the empire has long lost. To reward Chu, the Emperor re-opened the Sheriff Bureau. In addition to Ching, Chu has recruited <strong>Jui Ming</strong> (<em>Sammul Chan</em>) - a cunning swindler, <strong>Tit Sau</strong> (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>) - an honest guy, and the cold-blooded <strong>Lang Huet</strong> (Ron Ng) and called them ",The Four".  Sheriff Bureau has cracked many difficult cases under the leadership of Chu. After having gone through thick and thin with the others, Ching has become a lot less arrogant. He has fallen in love with <strong>Song Chi Yin</strong> (<em>Kate Tsui</em>), an herbal doctor, but she is only using him to sow dissension amongst "The Four". This furthermore deepens the hatred between him and Sau.  Emperor of Qi <strong>Chiu Cheong</strong> (<em>Savio Tsang</em>) and the treacherous minister <strong>Choi King</strong> (<em>Lau Kong</em>) are plotting to revolt against the Sung Dynasty. Chu risks his life to ruin their plan, but by doing this, he is also driving the bond between him and "The Four" to the verge of disintegration...</p>

Because her father treats her very well, she became an obstinated girl. Her mind is very simple, so she is too impulsive in doing things. She always self-proclaims she has good martial-arts, but in fact she doesn't have.</div>
              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">she's the only daughter of Nam Po Tin (<em>Gordon Liu</em>), the leader of the Blue Sky Clan, a large association in the politics. Full of freedom, acting as a Big Missy, she follows her father to ",make business". She thinks she is full of experience and very capable. But because of her father and the clan helps her, she actually has no real skills.</div>
              <div id="happenings" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Fei follows Tin as participant in a Sword Assembly of Emperor Chiu Cheong (<em>Savio Tsang</em>), Tin was suspected as murder and got arrested by the constable Tit Sau (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>). Because of this, Fei and Tit Sau had conflicts several times, but unfortunately she lost. She wants to take revenge on Tit Sau. , Tit Sau, who's loyal to the King's Assembly and as member of San Bo Si, still have a lot of conflicts with the Blue Sky Clan. Fei's personality isn't bad, so he tried to convince her to turn good. Or else she'll be arrested. Fei can feel Tit Sau's sense of justice. But she cannot forget about the political arena. When Fei was trying to help her "brothers" from the Clan, she decided to help the Dalian League against the republic, which has as result that she got arrested by Tit Sau. In prison, Fei remains stubbornly and refuses to turn good. But Tit Sau is very concerned about her and often visits her. The two meet each other very often in jail and starts to develop feelings.  Fei gets persuaded by Tit Sau again and thought about it thrice, she finally decided to start over again. After she was released from prison, she convinces Tin to turn Blue Sky Clan into the good side. Her father refuses first, making the father-daughter relationship going bad, but in the end, she successes persuading her father.  that moment, Tin died out of sudden. After Tit Sau and Fei investigated this, they found out it's Sek's murderous scheme, it came like a thunderclap for Fei. Tit Sau promised her that he'll arrest Sek, he urged her not to be impetuous by taking revenge herself. But in order to be trusted by minister Choi King (<em>Lau Kong</em>), Sek was shielded by him and Tit Sau couldn't do anything to him. Fei couldn't bear the grief and anger, she gathered the Clan members, ignored Tit Sau's preclusion and seek Sek for revenge. Because of this, the two broke up. As result, Fei isn't a match for Sek, her group of brothers were injured or died. Fei was lucky to be rescued by Tit Sau, she felt very sad when she reflects the result of her impetuous action.  this point, King and Sek slander Tit Sau's master Chu Kot Ching Ngo (<em>Dominic Lam</em>) for rebelling. Fei supported Tit Sau with searching for evidence, she testified King and Sek for trying to commit coup. The two worked together, plus the constables Mo Ching (<em>Raymond Lam</em>), Jui Ming (<em>Sammul Chan</em>) and Lang Huet (<em>Ron Ng</em>), they finally succeeded in exposing King and Sek's crimes.
