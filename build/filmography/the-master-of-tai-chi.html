        <p>Orphaned as a child, <strong>Mo Ma</strong> (<em>Vincent Zhao</em>) grew up in the country and started learning Tai Chi from his mentor at a very young age. The devastating experience of being abandoned by his mother has left him twisted and full of hatred. To help remove the anger and hatred in Ma's heart, his mentor finally sacrifices his own life. To express gratitude to his mentor, and to accomplish the will of his father, Ma seeks to pursue the highest level of Tai Chi. He challenges <strong>Tuen Hiu-Sing</strong> (<em>Raymond Lam</em>), the leader of the top-ranked Chong Lung Sect, to a contest but is defeated in the end. To beat Sing has then become his only goal. For a girl named <strong>Yin Chi-Kwai</strong> (<em>Myolie Wu</em>) and the ambitious martial arts master <strong>Lui Yau-Ngo</strong> (<em>Derek Kwok</em>), Ma and Sing get into fights again and again. As Ma is on the road to his dream, the gap between him and his soul-mate <strong>Song Ching</strong> (<em>Melissa Ng</em>) is growing wider and wider.</p>

              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">known as army leader Yin Pak To's illegitimate daughter, because her biological mother died early, she lived with her father's family. However, her status in the family is humble, her half sister Ji Kwai (<em>Myolie Wu</em>) treats her as an ordinary maid. Though, she never complained, submissive, she treats Ji Kwai with love as her own biological sister. Towards love relationships, with her mother's shadow, Chui Kiu persistently longs for an identity, she felt that she must be the first wife and absolutely not the concubine. This is because in her life, she constantly lived under the order of other people. She desires to justifiably become someone's first wife, owning a family which belongs to herself. In order to achieve this dream, sometimes she'll not hesitate to use her beauty, hoping to retain a man's heart.</div>
              <div id="happenings" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Because of the military strife during the turbulent times, the army of her father Yin Pak To lost power and Chui Kiu followed the entire family in their escape. Due to mistrusting the information, they fell into the ambush of enemies, causing their parents and younger brother to die. Fortunately, Mo Ma (<em>Vincent Zhao</em>) and Mei Fung Nin (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>) came to their rescue in time. She and her half sister Ji Kwai could escape safely.  Kiu, with Ji Kwai tagging along, did not have anyone to depend upon. She was feeling very lost and hoped to find a trustworthy man to rely on, instead of wandering the streets. At this moment, because of an accident, Chui Kiu fell into the river. Fung Nin jumped in to save her. Both of them were drenched throughout, and as Fung Nin could not control his feelings, they had a one-night-stand together. Chui Kiu thought that Fung Nin was a man whom she could depend on for life and also take care of her younger sister, but she was unaware that he already had a fiancee, Song Ching (<em>Melissa Ng</em>).  Kiu planned to find a place to settle down with Ji Kwai, but the latter was obsessed with revenge, and Chui Kiu could not stop her. Fearing to lose her only kin left, she devised a plan to trick Mo Ma into taking revenge on Ji Kwai's behalf. However unexpectedly, Mo Ma became a murderer because of this, and was sentenced to death. Chui Kiu was guilty over this, but to protect Ji Kwai, she did not care.  Kiu wanted to be Fung Nin's wife wholeheartedly. After Ji Kwai escaped to Shanghai alone to avoid her marriage agreement, Chui Kiu settled down in the capital with Fung Nin. As she held onto a secret formula of herbal tea from her late mother, she decided to open a snacks stall with Fung Nin to earn their keep.  day, Chui Kiu met Ji Kwai again but discovered that she had already lost her memories, and even became Cheong Lung Sect young master Tuen Hiu Sing's (<em>Raymond Lam</em>) cousin. After considering the situation, she felt that Ji Kwai would be safer being with Hiu Sing than reverting to her original identity, thus she pretended not to know Ji Kwai at all. But in actual fact, she was still concerned over her sister's matters. Later Ji Kwai recollected all her memories and wanted Chui Kiu to keep this secret. Since Ji Kwai was her only kin, she obliged to every request she made, and their relationship improved much more since then.</div>
