If not, they should break up. However, she still longs for a happy marriage and hopes to live with her lover till death.</div>
              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Bo Lok knows that she was born as a beautiful baby, but still strongly maintains her good figure, she does not want one single extra fat.
