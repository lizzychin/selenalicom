During this period, she learnt how to be self-reliant and has then developed an independent personality. After graduating from University of Hong Kong, she then went to United States to work and study part-time. During the period while she was working in a famous shop, she met Wing Yiu (<em>Vincent Wong</em>). They both got to know each other only for seven days, and then were married happily. But behind the truth, they were only husband-and-wife through an agreement. They were married only to help to strengthen the company, and were only nominal couple.  returning to Hong Kong, Hailey joined the company and hold an important position that her commercial skill are progressing very well. Even the subordinates also agree that she is the most efficient person in the company. Hailey and Fan Suk Heung (<em>Myolie Wu</em>) are secondary school mates and were as close as sisters. However because Hailey went overseas to study, they both gradually drifted apart.</div>

Suk Heung trust Hailey and complained and cried to her when she suspected that her husband Ku Ka Yan (<em>Johnson Lee</em>) had an extramarital affair. Hailey knew about the magical website through Suk Heung, and both decided to use the website to exchange identity to use her ability to help Suk Heung snatch back her husband. When the exchange of identities have been confirmed, and had misunderstandings, both wanted to switch back to their own identities but couldn’t because of the library renovation. Thus, both of them couldn’t get hold of the magical website and have to temporarily continue with their “new identity”.  Hailey is not used to housewife lifestyle, thus she also lacks of patience in handling family problems. Her way of handling matters made Suk Heung very discontented. On the other hand, she also found out that Suk Heung has caused her trouble by constantly provoking her husband and mother-in-law Lui Fung (<em>Kiki Sheung</em>), and this caused Hailey to have a big headache, giving her the resistant to restore back the original identity. At the same time, she is also tired of having such wealthy lifestyle, and has found the family warmth in the Ku family. She is also being slowly attracted to Ka Yan, and couldn’t restrain from showing her love…  Heung found out that Hailey had intentions on Ka Yan. There was a misunderstanding during that period which made Suk Heung think that Hailey was having an affair with her husband. Suk Heung forced Hailey to switch back their identities and this caused more dispute during an occasion whereby both accidentally destroyed the only computer which had the magical website. This caused both of them unable to restore to their original identities and subsequently, their quarrels ended. In order to prevent Suk Heung from snatching away her husband, Hailey joined the company as a secretary, and during the period, she actually discovered that she has all along been in love with her husband…</div>
