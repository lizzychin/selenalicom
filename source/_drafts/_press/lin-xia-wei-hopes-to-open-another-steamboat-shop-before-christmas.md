The steamboat restaurant invested by Lin Xia Wei (林夏薇) is officially open on 15 December. Her good friends in showbiz including Rebecca Zhu (朱晨麗), Stefan Wong (黃長興) and his family, Selena Li (李施嬅) and Tony Hung (洪永城) turned up to show their supports and when asked about the investment as it was the 10th branch, Xia Wei said: "Will be opening 11th branch soon and hope to open it before Christmas. It will be located in Hong Kong island. (Paving the road for career change?) Nope. It is another issue and I love filming all along."

Rebecca expressed Xia Wei supported her art exhibition before thus she specially turned up to support her: "She opens many branches and it is my first time to patronise her. (Will invest?) It does not cross my mind. I enjoy filming and doing my art exhibition now."
