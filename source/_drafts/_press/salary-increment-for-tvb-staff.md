Actress Selena Li (李施嬅) attended a poon choi function by TVB and when asked if her salary was increased as TVB announced the salary increment for their staff, she said: "I belong to the 'celebrity' category. I filmed Presumed Accidents (純熟意外) series, made cameo appearance in few series and managed to be nominated for TV Queen award. The salary increment is 1.5%? I can buy car now. (But 1.5% only.) Haha. Good! I have more money to give red packet during Lunar New Year and hope to win some cash award tonight, so as to celebrate Mandy Wong's (黃智雯) birthday."
