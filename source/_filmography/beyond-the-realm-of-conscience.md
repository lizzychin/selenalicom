It is comprised of four departments, namely Jewels, Attire, Food and Furnishings. LAU SAM-HO <small>(Charmaine Sheh)</small> and YIU KAM-LING <small>(Tavia Yeung)</small> are introduced into the bureau in their tender age and brought up in the disciplines of the palace. The two girls are diligent. YUEN TSUI-WAN <small>(Susanna Kwan)</small>, Head of the Jewels, and CHUNG SUET-HA <small>(Michelle Yim)</small>, Head of the Attire, are both very fond of Ho for she is a kindhearted young girl. Soon, they start fighting for the fellowship of Ho.</p><p>Ho always remembers her mother’s words left to her before she passed away, that she was told, “Doing good deeds, Speaking good words, Showing goodwill”. She lives her life of being gracious and kind-hearted in the palace. On the other hand, Ling believes her survival in palace is achieved through cruel and calculating tactics. She cheats and schemes her way to the top and finally becomes the concubine.</p><p>Though she realizes that Ho has fallen in love with the chess master KO HIN-YEUNG <small>(Kevin Cheng)</small>, her jealousy still arouses by Ho’s attraction to the EMPEROR LEE YI <small>(Moses Chan)</small>. Fearing that she is losing power, she ruthlessly makes up a false allegation against Ho for murdering the Empress <small>(Mary Hon)</small> and condemns her to death. No matter how clever she is to scheme, things do not go the way she planned. By using a strong comparison of the two distinctive characters, Ho and Ling, the message of the drama is that “benevolence” is the only way to gain final victory.
