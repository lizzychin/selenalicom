Later on, Yiu-Ming unveils that there is quite a story behind Kin-Ching's personality that makes everyone keep a distance from her. Eventually, Yiu-Ming finds a new job with a property management company. Unknown to him, his arrival ruins Lo Pit-Tat's (<em>Evergreen Mak</em>) hope of getting promoted, so Pit-Tat, a third-generation brick slave, for the sake of keeping his own job becomes completely incompatible with Yiu-Ming at work.
