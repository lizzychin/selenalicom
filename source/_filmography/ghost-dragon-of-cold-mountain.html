synopsis: The Tin Kei Agency of the Northern Song, an investigation agency specializing
  in solving strange cases in the kingdom, is headed by the wise <strong>Fung Nam-Tin</strong>
  (<em>Lau Kong</em>), who leads a group of extremely well-trained constables. His
  favorite apprentice, <strong>Chu Cheung-Sing</strong> (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>), is
  wisdom and courage embodied in one, but Nam Tin and Cheung Sing end their partnership
  when they fail to come to a consensus on how to solve a particular case. Cheung
  Sing ends up leaving the agency to live a simple and peaceful life with his wife,
  <strong>Tou Fa</strong> (<em>Selena Lee</em>).  years later, the aging Nam Tin orders
  three of his most-skilled apprentices – <strong>Ma Chuen-Kung</strong> (<em>Power
  Chan</em>), <strong>Ngau Dai-Lik</strong> (<em>Pierre Ngo</em>), and <strong>Yeung
  Mau</strong> (<em>Lin Xiawei</em>) – to reach out to Cheung Sing and convince him
  to return. Cheung Sing agrees to work with the agency again, but his personality
  often clashes with his three partners, causing the four to frequently fight. Meanwhile,
  Cheung Sing is separated from his wife, but his feelings become conflicted when
  he ends up meeting a prostitute who looks exactly like her.  Sing learns that the
  opposing Jurchen kingdom has placed a mole within the Tin Kei Agency and his good
  friend, <strong>Hung Sup-Kau</strong> (<em>Raymond Cho</em>) is exploited by the
  enemy. Cheung Sing does not know whom to trust. The line between friend and foe
  continues to be blurry.
