Po Sang feels down-hearted, his close associate <strong>Cheng Po-Po</strong> (<em>Aimee Chan</em>), a female TV producer, remains steadfast with loyalty to him, fighting with him side-by-side all along. Even when Po Sang suffers from a fracture due to a boating accident and becomes physically disabled, Po Po is willing to push the wheelchair for him. On the other hand, <strong>Kwok Hei-Man</strong> (<em>Selena Lee</em>) gives up her own career all of a sudden and returns to Cheung Chau, helping her mother <strong>Ip Wing-Shan</strong> (<em>Susan Tse</em>) run the holiday home rental business. It turns out that Hei-Man has secretly joined hands with some outsiders, planning to develop a hotel conglomerate. Hei Man also attempts to have an affair with Po-Sang, trying to make Po Po go away. What Hei Man has done is noticed by her first love <strong>Ching Lai-Wing</strong> (<em>Ruco Chan</em>), who cannot put up with it, as such, he and Po-Po become fellow sufferers, commiserating with each other. As Po Po is about to give up verifying her parentage and return to the USA, unexpectedly, a sudden reversal of the holiday home acquisition process occurs…"
