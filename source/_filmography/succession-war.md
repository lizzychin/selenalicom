synopsis:       The rise and fall of dynasties and the changing of sovereigns are dictated by the Mandate of Heaven. HESHEN <small>(Ruco Chan)</small> dominates the court, with power in his hands and wealth that rivals the nation. He is a minister that is closer to imperial power than the Emperor. Emperor JIAQING <small>(Shaun Tam)</small> has the title, but no power; he falls victim to the times. He is a ruler that is further from power than ordinary citizens. Within 28 days, a battle between power and righteousness. Ultimately, will man prevail over the heavens, or is the Mandate of Heaven not to be violated?
