Feeling lonely in the palace, she frequently hung around in Bureau of Peace and Prosperity and was attracted by the young male opera performer Yuk Chun <small>(Vin Choi)</small>. The two fell in love and got into an illicit affair. Later she discovered that she got pregnant. Upon learning of her pregnancy, Yuk Chun unexpectedly left her. Disheartened by this, Consort Yuen had no choice but to give birth to her son and declared he was Xianfeng’s. When the baby was born, Cixi finds out that the baby isn’t Xianfeng’s biological child. She ordered people to take away Consort Yuen’s son and had him killed. Consort Yuen was put in the cold palace thereafter."
happenings:     Having a peaceful and dull life in the Palace of Great Benevolence, Consort Yuen treats her group of eunuchs and maids like family and lives together harmoniously.

However, Lin Yin and the others do not know at all what she has committed to deserve this. Consort Yuen never has any desires. However, when she hears that Cixi announced that all consorts of the emperor will be allowed to leave the palace, and herself being the only one to die of old age in the Forbidden Palace, she feels that life is dreary and hence decides to hang herself…
