The tale begins on the seventh of August, when Wing and Yan first encounter their own dream girl on the same island. Wing works as a lifeguard on the outlying island. He gets to know pet shop assistant LING KA-YAN <small>(Niki Chow)</small> by chance and is soon mesmerized by her endearing personality. Yan who works at a coffee shop meets a romance comic artist called WONG CHI-KWAN <small>(Natalie Tong)</small>. Being misled into believing that the girl is from a rich family, Yan decides to chase her. He would never have thought that someone as calculating as himself would end up falling into a love trap…
