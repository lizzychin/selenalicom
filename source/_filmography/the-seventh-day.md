synopsis:       "Different people have different attitudes to love - even those born on the same day in the same year do not necessarily share the same views. <strong>Yau Chi-Wing</strong> (<em>Kevin Cheng</em>) and <strong>Hui Wai-Yan</strong> (<em>Bosco Wong</em>) were both born on the seventh day of August, but one takes relationships seriously while the other is so money-minded and sees love as a tool to get higher up the social ladder.  tale begins on the seventh of August, when Wing and Yan first encounter their own dream girl on the same island. Wing works as a lifeguard on the outlying island. He gets to know pet shop assistant <strong>Ling Ka-Yan</strong> (<em>Niki Chow</em>) by chance and is soon mesmerized by her endearing personality. Yan who works at a coffee shop meets a romance comic artist called <strong>Wong Chi-Kwan</strong> (<em>Natalie Tong</em>). Being misled into believing that the girl is from a rich family, Yan decides to chase her. He would never have thought that someone as calculating as himself would end up falling into a love trap."
