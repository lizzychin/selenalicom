  synopsis:       "Once upon a time, a free-spirited musician, John, fell in love with a straitlaced banker Jessica. It was a whirlwind romance that led to a HDB BTO flat-application within three months of their first date. Before you know it, however, the heady flush of impetuous love faded and the attraction soon paved way to replusion. Despite their aversion towards one another, neither was willing to give the flat up. They now have two options: to sort out their differences and make the marriage work, or drive the other up the wall and out of the house. They will soon find out that marriage isn't just about two people. Together with the married couple, their parents, in-laws, brothers and sisters are all caught in the crossfire, resulting in comedic hijinks and life lessons to be learnt."
