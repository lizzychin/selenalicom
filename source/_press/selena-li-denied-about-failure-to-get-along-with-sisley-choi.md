Actress Selena Li (李施嬅), Sisley Choi (蔡思貝), Winki Lai (賴慰玲), Snow Suen (孫慧雪) were promoting Presumed Accidents (純熟意外) series at Kwun Tong. When mentioned about her scenes were lesser due to Sisley and ended up in argument, Selena clarified that she made cameo appearance and denied about failing to get along with Sisley: "I make cameo appearance only. (Minded that your role is villain?) I only look at roles if there is any improvements. They will not cut my scenes because of Sisley Choi."

### No intention of leaving
Selena disclosed she had two years contract with TVB and no intention of leaving: "I renewed with TVB two years ago and have two more years contract left." Mentioning about the film producer was fair to every cast member and praised Selena had good acting skills, he said: "The role is very important and she acted very well. (Rumoured that Sisley wrote on the paper that she liked you?) It is fake."
