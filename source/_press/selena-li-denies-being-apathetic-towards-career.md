In the public’s eye, Selena Li (李施嬅) has a worry-free life. She’s always carried the image of being unambitious and apathetic, with an “I don’t care” attitude towards her career.

But that’s not how Selena’s like at all.

“It’s not that I’m worry-free,” said the actress. “It’s because I’m not a very good speaker. I don’t know how to take action.”

In the TVB drama Presumed Accidents <純熟意外>, which finished its broadcast earlier this month, Selena played three different characters. The efforts in preparing for a multi-character role is like that of preparing for the filming of three different dramas, but these are opportunities that Selena are more than happy to take. The public has always considered Selena as someone who is carefree and apathetic, but Selena, who films one to two dramas per year, wants to clarify this once and for all.

“Actors are very passive,” she said. “I want to film more dramas too. I am always ready for them. I’ve never turned down a single drama since my debut, and I do believe that the company are always on the lookout for roles for me. Even Myolie Wu (胡杏兒) has told me that I’m not being aggressive enough. It’s not that I’m worry-free. Maybe it’s because I’m not a very good speaker. I don’t know how to take action. But this is my personality. Producers who have worked with me all know who I’m like. It’s true that I’m not being aggressive enough. Perhaps I really need to change!”

The 35-year-old actress, who made her debut in 2003 after auditioning for Miss Hong Kong, is thankful to have a circle of close friends in the industry. Myolie Wu, Nancy Wu (胡定欣), Elaine Yiu (姚子羚), Mandy Wong (黃智雯), and Paisley Wu (胡蓓蔚) are Selena’s support system, and they’ll always be there for each other.

“We’re all from the same company, so to an extent, we are also competitors,” said Selena. “But we do not carry a competitive heart. We only think about the best for each other.”

On the topic of food, Selena shared that she and her Presumed Accidents costar Lawrence Ng (吳啟華) bonded through their shared interest in cooking. Lawrence would sometimes bring some home-cooked meals to work so he could share it with the cast and crew.

Asking if she finds men who can cook to be admirable, she said, “I love cooking myself so I’m quite demanding when it comes to food. To be able to eat home-cooked meals and to know that your family is at home waiting for you is a very blissful feeling! I’ll definitely be happy if my partner can cook, but to have someone who eats your home-cooked meals is a happy thing too.”
