Actress Selena Li (李施嬅) wore revealing dress to play piano alone and placed her leg on the piano suddenly during live broadcast of TVB Anniversary Gala (萬千星輝賀台慶) and it became the hottest topic in town immediately. Selena accepted an interview from ON.CC (東網) and said that she was trying to make the atmosphere more lively and admitted there was difficulty playing the piano despite having 10 grade: "I was quite nervous as the performance was quite difficult on that night. My purpose is to make the atmosphere more lively but many people commented it was too sexy and I do not feel it that way. Haha!"
