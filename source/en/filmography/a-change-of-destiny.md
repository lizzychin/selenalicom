synopsis:       YIP YEUNG (Benny Chan) has been so interested in the “Tui Bei Tu”, a reportedly very accurate prophetic book which can help improve one’s luck in the most effective way. YUEN HEI (Steven Ma) therefore snaps up the chance to con money out of Yeung with a fake “Tui Bei Tu”. But his lie is soon exposed by the owner of the real “Tui Bei Tu” LEE SHING-TIN (Yuen Wah), who is now renamed WAN CHUNG-HOK. Years ago Tin presented the “Tui Bei Tu” to CHIU HONG-YAN (Kwok Fung), which brought the military officer to the throne of the Chinese Song empire. Tin is an expert at divination. He takes on Yeung and Hei as his apprentices, hoping to teach them everything he knows. Yeung later betrays Tin and refers to another divination specialist NAM FONG-MAN (Lau Kong) as his mentor. Yeung learns from Man that he himself is a descendant of the previous royal family. He is then resolved to topple Emperor TAI CHO’s government and win back the throne by using divination. Yeung has made careful calculations to change his fate, but fate always has a different game to play…
