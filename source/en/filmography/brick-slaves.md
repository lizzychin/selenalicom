synopsis:       LAU YIU-MING (Vincent Wong) exhausts the money that he and his girlfriend have saved for many years to buy a property and is about to get married. Out of the blue, his girlfriend not only wants to break up with him, but also secretly leases the premises out to a piano teacher, CHOI KIN-CHING (Selena Lee). Unfortunately, Yiu-Ming’s bad day gets even worse as he is soon laid off from work. In order to continue to pay the mortgage, Yiu-Ming has no other choice but to accept the unreasonable condition imposed by Kin-Ching, however the two often have arguments due to their differences in lifestyles. Later on, Yiu-Ming unveils that there is quite a story behind Kin-Ching’s personality that makes everyone keep a distance from her. Eventually, Yiu-Ming finds a new job with a property management company. Unknown to him, his arrival ruins LO PIT-TAT’s (Evergreen Mak) hope of getting promoted, so Pit-Tat, a third-generation brick slave, for the sake of keeping his own job becomes completely incompatible with Yiu-Ming at work. Nevertheless, Yiu-Ming gains recognition from his boss, LI OI-WAH (Kiki Sheung), who even urges him to specifically look after a trainee called CHUK PIK-KEI (Eliza Sam). Due to their work, Yiu-Ming and Pik-Kei get to observe the world around the brick slaves. Pik-Kei gradually falls in love with Yiu-Ming, yet Yiu-Ming knows very well whom he really loves. All of a sudden, Kin-Ching requests to end the tenancy…
