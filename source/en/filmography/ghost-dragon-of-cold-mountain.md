synopsis:       During the Northern Song Dynasty, Phecda Bureau led by FUNG NAM-TIN (Lau Kong) along with his elite group is in charge of all the mysterious criminal cases nationwide. Its power is superior to all the other government offices, and even surpasses the Six Ministries. Commander CHU CHEUNG-SING (Kenneth Ma) is brave and intelligent, and is greatly valued by his mentor Nam-Tin. However, due to a robbery case, he and his mentor have a disagreement and split up, going their separate ways. Bringing along his wife TAO FA (Selena Lee), Cheung-Sing has vanished from sight for almost ten years until recently when the case draws to a close. As Nam-Tin is in his advanced age, Field Officer MA CHUEN-KUNG (Power Chan), NGAU TAI-LIK (Pierre Ngo) and YEUNG MAU (Rosina Lin) are under orders to summon Cheung-Sing back. Although the four of them jointly solve cold cases one by one, their distinctive personalities often lead to conflicts among them.<br> Unexpectedly, Tao Fa and Cheung-Sing diverge from each other as a result of a misunderstanding. After that, Cheung-Sing encounters a famous prostitute YAN MEI-LEUNG (Selena Lee), who bears the same resemblance to his wife and takes Cheung-Sing’s breath away. In the meantime, the Jin Dynasty has long been coveting the Song land, and is ready to launch an invasion. Cheung-Sing notices that the Jin spies have penetrated into the Bureau, whereas his best friend, gangster HUNG SAP-KAU (Raymond Cho), has also been taken advantage of. With those surrounding him being in danger one after another, it’s difficult to define friends or foes, rendering everyone on tenterhooks...
