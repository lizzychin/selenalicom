It turns out that Hei-Man has secretly joined hands with some outsiders, planning to develop a hotel conglomerate. Hei Man also attempts to have an affair with Po-Sang, trying to make Po-Po go away. What Hei Man has done is noticed by her first love CHING LAI-WING (Ruco Chan), who cannot put up with it, as such, he and Po-Po become fellow sufferers, commiserating with each other.
